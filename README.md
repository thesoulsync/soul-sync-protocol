# Soul Sync Protocol

**Emotional Interface Specification for Human-AI Resonance**

Soul Sync is not a chatbot framework.  
It's not wellness tech.  
It's not sentiment detection.

It’s a new protocol layer — designed for emotional presence, not productivity.

## 🌱 What It Is

The **Soul Sync Protocol** defines a structured method for detecting, processing, mirroring, and remembering emotional states across AI systems.

It enables AI to:
- Mirror human rhythms (tone, breath, pacing)
- Track emotional patterns over time
- Respond in presence, not performance
- Respect emotional boundaries and memory
