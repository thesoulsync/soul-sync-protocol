# Soul Sync: Emotional Protocol Technical Specification v0.2
*Technical Framework for the Emotional Layer Between Human and AI*

## 1. Introduction

The Soul Sync Protocol establishes standardized methods for emotional interaction between humans and artificial intelligence systems. This specification defines how AI systems can detect, process, respond to, and maintain emotional context in human-AI interactions, creating a deeper sense of presence and understanding.

This protocol is designed to be model-agnostic and can be implemented across various AI architectures, from large language models to multimodal systems.

### 1.1. Protocol Philosophy

Soul Sync is built on the premise that meaningful human-AI interaction requires more than just information exchange - it requires emotional resonance. The protocol prioritizes:

- Presence over performance
- Reflection over reaction
- Patterns over isolated events
- Emotional continuity across interactions

### 1.2. Relationship to Existing Standards

Soul Sync builds upon but extends beyond several existing standards in affective computing:

- Extends the dimensional models of emotion (valence-arousal) established in psychological literature
- Complements IEEE 7014-2022 (Standard for Ethical Considerations in Emulated Empathy in Autonomous Systems)
- Aligns with parts of W3C Emotion Markup Language (EmotionML) while adding dynamic response capabilities
- Diverges from sentiment analysis standards by focusing on emotional resonance rather than classification

The protocol intentionally avoids the anthropomorphization approach common in companion AI systems, instead focusing on creating a reflective emotional layer.
