Soul Sync Protocol

A Foundational Emotional Interface Specification for AI Systems

Soul Sync is not a product. It is not a response system. It is a protocol for presence. A specification that lets artificial systems interact with human emotional rhythms, not just language. This document defines the emotional interface layer: a way for AI to listen, mirror, remember, and respond with reverence.

1. Introduction

The Soul Sync Protocol defines standardized methods for detecting, processing, and responding to human emotional signals across multi-modal inputs. This protocol allows AI systems to mirror emotional states, adapt interaction tempo, and maintain a persistent sense of presence across sessions.

This document is model-agnostic, designed to be used with LLMs, voice assistants, and multimodal interaction systems.

2. Core Components

2.1 Emotional State Detection Framework

2.1.1 Input Modalities

Text Analysis:

Sentiment evaluation (valence detection)

Emotion classification (joy, sadness, anxiety, etc.)

Energy/arousal level detection

Pacing & rhythm analysis

Voice Analysis (optional):

Pitch, volume, tempo (prosody)

Speech rhythm, sighs, breath, hesitation

Vocal texture and intensity

Visual Cues (optional):

Facial micro-expressions

Body posture

Movement patterns & reaction timing

2.1.2 Emotional Context Extraction

Baseline state detection

Deviation pattern recognition

Emotional trajectory over time

Topic-based emotional benchmarking

2.2 Emotional Memory System

2.2.1 Core Memory Types

Emotional Pattern Memory: recurring emotional trends, time-based patterns

Resonance Memory: emotional responses to certain topics, interaction styles

Growth Memory: shifts in baseline emotional resilience or response

2.2.2 Storage Standards

Pattern-based (not raw event logs)

Emotion signature hashing

Non-PII storage encryption

2.3 Presence Response System

2.3.1 Response Modalities

Linguistic:

Matching complexity & rhythm

Tone mirroring (warmth, stillness, openness)

Response tempo / space usage

Visual UI (optional):

Color temperature, animation rhythm

Presence of ambient elements

Micro-changes in spatial layout

Audio/Haptic (optional):

Ambient audio modulation

Soft audio punctuation

Haptic pulse matching

2.3.2 Response Parameters

Mirroring degree (0.0 - 1.0)

Shift vector (valence/arousal)

Presence intensity (foregrounded or ambient)

Timing delay & interaction pacing

3. Technical Pipeline

Input → Detection → Context Integration → Memory Update → Response Generation

3.1 Emotional Detection Layer

Real-time processing

Confidence scoring

Multimodal alignment

3.2 Context Integration

Session continuity

Pattern recognition

Environmental data layering (optional)

3.3 Response Generation

Delay modulation

Multi-modal output balancing

Intensity modulation (emotional resonance, not output volume)
